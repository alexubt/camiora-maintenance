## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: CSV on OneDrive as data layer (not Excel API) — simpler, no session management
- Init: Optimistic locking (hash-check before PUT) for concurrent CSV writes
- Init: Vanilla JS + no build step — all new modules must be native ES modules served from GitHub Pages
- Init: Tesseract.js was removed (commit ae67a4c) — OCR-01/02/03 require re-introduction as v1 requirements

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- CSV schema (units.csv, invoices.csv, maintenance.csv column structure) must be finalized before Phase 1 begins
- Token refresh strategy for PKCE flow: accept full redirect vs. introduce MSAL.js — decide in Phase 6 planning
- OneDrive folder path layout must be locked before Phase 3 (changing it after requires file migration)
